### What I learned

element+element selector
::marker pseudo-element

### Useful resources

- [element+element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Next-sibling_combinator) - This helped me find way make margins for list items without nth child. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [::marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Ul, Ol styling. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
